## Convert an Example to PDF

Replace `&lt;your-token&gt;` with a valid API key.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v0/pdf \
  -H "X-API-Key: <your-token>" \
  -F "html=@examples/invoice.html" \
  --output invoice.pdf
```

### Fetch a Remote Page

The service can also fetch remote content directly:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost/api/v0/pdf?url=https://example.com" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <your-token>" \
  --output page.pdf
```

Tokens must be supplied in all requests and standard rate limiting applies. Feel free to fork these templates and customize them for your own projects. All resources are loaded via public CDNs, and images use deterministic seeds from picsum.photos.
